# ErnOneStick

OpenMW mod that allows you to play the game on devices that only have one analogue stick (or D-pad).

## Stick Controls
You change which mode you're in with the `Lock Button`, which you assign in the mod settings. You won't need the button that changes between first and third person (the mod assumes all control of camera modes).

In *travel mode*, you have tank controls. Forward and back move your character, left and right yaw the camera. Hold the Lock Button and then use your stick to enter *freelook mode*. Instead of holding, just tap the Lock Button to enter *target selection mode*. If enabled, attacking an NPC or Creature while in this mode will automatically put you into *lock-on mode*.

In *freelook mode*, your stick pitches and yaws the camera, but you can't move. When you release the Lock Button, you'll go back to *travel mode*. You'll need to enter this mode to aim up or down when swimming or levitating.

In *target selection mode*, push your stick up or down to cycle through actor targets. Push your stick left or right to cycle through all other targets. Tap the Lock Button to lock-on to your selected target and enter *lock-on mode*. Alternatively, use the `Activate` button to use the thing or talk to the person you are looking at. After using `Activate`, you be placed back into *travel mode*.

In *lock-on mode*, your camera will remain pinned on your target. Your stick moves back and forward and strafes. Tap the Lock Button to go back to *travel mode*.

## Super Toggle Button
You can optionally map a multi-function toggle key, if you are running out of buttons. Tap it to cycle through Hands Down, Ready Spell, and Ready Weapon. Long press to toggle Sneak.
